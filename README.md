# Cryptocurrency Wallet Watch

This is a data visualization app made with Python framework Flask, SQLite database,
React, HTML, and, CSS. 
walletwatch.xyz (https://walletwatch.xyz/) is a database visualizing and displaying website made with Python backend and React frontend.
 The App is useful in tracking your bitcoin investment progress. Instead of calculating how much money gained
  since yesterday, last week, and last month, the visualized data in the line chart will allow you to check
   your bitcoin balance for every hour. By calling a Flask API, the Python backend requests the bitcoin wallet
    data from Blockchain.com API with a designated wallet address.
     React frontend will receive the data return from Flask API and create a line chart.
The website is deployed on my Linux Ubuntu 20.10 server using nginx.
